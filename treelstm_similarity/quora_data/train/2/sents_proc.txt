A little and limited time that I 'm asking from her but she do n't wan na give it to me . She 's scared that someone might see us , that she 's still having an affair with me . I love her and I want to be with her at least once a week even if just for a limited time . I 'm not sure if I 'm doing the right thing , all of my friends told me to stop it and just let it go 2 months is just 2 months not a deep relationship .

I do the things for her that I 'm not used to for a girl and I am willing to sacrifice everything just to have a little time with her . A little and limited time that I 'm asking from her but she do n't wan na give it to me . She 's scared that someone might see us , that she 's still having an affair with me . I love her and I want to be with her at least once a week even if just for a limited time . I 'm not sure if I 'm doing the right thing , all of my friends told me to stop it and just let it go 2 months is just 2 months not a deep relationship . But they do n't feel what I feel , in this span of time I learned a lot , I learned how to love , to be loved , to sacrifice a good life , and to sacrifice a better clear future . My mind tells me to stop , but my heart tells me to hold , do n't give up , stay with her and give her the unconditional love . Should I follow my mind or follow my heart ?
